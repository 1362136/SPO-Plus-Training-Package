# SPO-Plus-Training-Package

This package faciliates training models that fall under the "predict then optimize" paradigm, in which the outputs of a supervised prediction model are leveraged as parameters for an underlying linear optimization problem. The package integrates with Gurobi API for python to solve linear optimization problems and takes full advantage of Pytorch's autograd feature.
